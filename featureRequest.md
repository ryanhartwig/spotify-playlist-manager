# Feature Request: Show User's Current Playlists to Edit, and Preview Songs

## Objective
Users will be able to see a list of their own playlists and can choose to edit them or remove them entirely (unfollow).

A user can also select a track to preview it. 

## Background
The playlist-manager as it is does not have any 'play track' functionality and does not allow the user to see any playlists they currently have. 

This feature will add key funcionality:
* Give users much more flexibility with their Spotify playlists
* Allow users to listen to selected tracks to preview their changes
* Edit their playlist order with ease by simply dragging and dropping
